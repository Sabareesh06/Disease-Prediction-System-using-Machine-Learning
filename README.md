# Disease-Prediction-System-using-Machine-Learning


Heart Disease Prediction Project Overview :
The Heart Disease Prediction project aims to develop an intelligent system that predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various health-related features. The system leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze historical health data, including factors such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical metrics.

Key Elements:


Technology Used:

Machine Learning: Random Forest Classifier for predictive modeling.
Data Processing Libraries: Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
Web Framework: Streamlit for creating an interactive user interface.


Domain:
Healthcare: Focused on heart disease, one of the leading causes of mortality globally, aiming to improve early diagnosis and treatment.


Problem Statement:
The project addresses the challenge of early detection of heart disease, which is crucial for effective treatment and prevention. By predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on user input of medical attributes, the system provides healthcare professionals and patients with valuable insights for proactive health management.

Usage:
This system will enable healthcare providers to identify high-risk individuals and intervene early, potentially reducing the incidence of heart disease. Additionally, it empowers patients with information about their health risks, promoting informed decision-making regarding lifestyle changes and medical consultations.
